Tx Snoop is an account tracking TUI that allows you to track transactions made
by an address.

Currently in development

---

Conceptual design is to have 3 main Views:

- Sidebar: address list
- Upper Right: address summary
- Lower Right: address transactions

We should be able to either `Tab` between panels or select them by an `1/2/3`

During the initial mockup, if there is a need we will make it responsive so we 
have a veritcally stacked interface for smaller windows to prioritise the table
width for the transaction information.
